&emsp; Most of my GitHub repositories will likely be private for the time being since I mostly just program for myself and will use GitHub as a way to store and organise my repositories as I work on different programming projects here and there, so if you'd really like to see more of my works outside of the ones made public, feel free to ask or otherwise contact me and I'll at least consider the kind request c':
